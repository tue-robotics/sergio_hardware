##### First test with the torso ####

ERRORS:
 -  A kabel blocks the end stop of the left knee when moving upwards
 -  End stop at the right knee when moving upwards does not work
 -  Buttens to move out of endstop are enabled by pressing the emergency button:
     *  This can be dangerous
     *  Possible protect these buttons with a case for safety
 -  Lower spindle brake is to weak.
 -  Encoder counter does not change when the spindle is moving but the brake is on
 -  After hitting the upwards endstops (both spindles), the restore button only moves
    down once. At the downwards endstops this works fine.
